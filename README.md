# MINI-PROJECT
FOOD SAFETY USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
# Title of the Project
This project focuses on developing a blockchain-based solution that enhances food safety by enabling secure and transparent tracking of food products throughout the supply chain. By leveraging Ethereum blockchain technology, it allows detailed information, including ingredients, expiration dates, and sources, to be stored immutably and accessed via QR codes. This provides consumers, suppliers, and regulators with reliable data for improved food traceability, quality control, and timely interventions, promoting accountability and building trust in food safety.
# About  
This project implements a blockchain solution to enhance food safety by tracking and verifying food products across the supply chain. Utilizing Ethereum blockchain, it records critical data such as ingredients, expiry dates, and origin details, which can be accessed through a QR code. This transparent system enables real-time, secure access to food information, assisting consumers and suppliers in verifying quality, ensuring traceability, and supporting timely interventions to maintain high food safety standards.
# Features
Blockchain-Based Traceability: Utilizes Ethereum blockchain to securely record and track food product data across the entire supply chain.
Real-Time Data Access: Provides consumers and suppliers with instant access to food information, including ingredients, origin, and expiry dates, via a QR code.
Immutable Records: Ensures data integrity with tamper-proof, unalterable records that promote transparency and trust among all stakeholders.
Interoperable Data Structure: Stores and outputs data in a standardized format, facilitating easy integration with existing supply chain management and regulatory systems.
Enhanced Food Safety: Supports timely interventions and quality control by enabling quick verification of product authenticity and safety compliance.
# Requirements
Operating System: Compatible with a 64-bit OS (Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04, or later) to support blockchain frameworks and development tools.
Development Environment: Node.js and Python 3.8 or later for smart contract scripting and data handling.
Blockchain Platform: Ethereum network for smart contract deployment and data transparency.
Smart Contract Development Frameworks: Solidity for writing contracts, Truffle or Hardhat for deployment and testing, and Ganache for local blockchain simulations.
Data Processing Libraries: Pandas and JSON libraries for organizing and managing food supply chain data, Web3.py or web3.js for blockchain communication.
Version Control: Git for collaborative development and project versioning.
IDE: Visual Studio Code for coding, debugging, and integrated version control.
Additional Libraries and Tools: IPFS for decentralized storage of product information, QR code libraries for user-friendly data access, and Ethers.js for Ethereum blockchain transactions.

# Results and Impact
The Food Safety Using Blockchain Technology project provides a transparent and secure method for tracking food products from source to consumer, enhancing accountability and trust in the food supply chain. By using Ethereum blockchain to store immutable records of food information, including origin, ingredients, and expiration dates, the project enables faster, real-time verification of product authenticity. Consumers gain peace of mind through QR code access to detailed product histories, while suppliers benefit from streamlined traceability and quality assurance processes. This project highlights blockchain's potential to advance food safety standards, reduce the risk of contamination, and support timely interventions, promoting a safer, more reliable food system for all stakeholders.
